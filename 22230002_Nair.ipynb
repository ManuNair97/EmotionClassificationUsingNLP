        "Tweet 1: @NationalGallery @ThePoldarkian I have always loved this painting.\n",
        "Tweet 2: '@tateliverpool #BobandRoberta: I am angry more artists that have a profile are not speaking up #foundationcourses.'\n",

        "How would you describe the emotions in `Tweet 1` vs `Tweet 2`? `Tweet 1` expresses enjoyment and happiness, while `Tweet 2` directly expresses anger. For this assignment, we will be working with the SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1619/paper3.pdf)). At a high level, our goal is to develop different models (rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning), which can be used to identify the emotion of a tweet. You will be required to clean and preprocess the data, generate features for classification, train various models, and evaluate the models. \n",

        "Now that we have a dataset, let's work on developing some solutions for emotion classification. We'll start with implementing a simple rule-based classifier which will also serve as our naive baseline. Emotive language (e.g. awesome, feel great, super happy) can be a strong signal as to the overall emotion being by the tweet. For each emotion in our label space (happy, surprised, sad, angry) we will generate a set of words and phrases that are often associated with that emotion. At classification time, the classifier will calculate a score based on the overlap between the words in the tweet and the emotive words and phrases for each of the emotions. The emotion label with the highest overlap will be selected as the prediction and if there is no match the \"no-emotion\" label will be predicted. We can break the implementation of this rules-based classifier into three steps:\n",

Using the training data you will need to extract all the unique unigrams and bigrams associated with each label (excluding no-emotion). Then you should ensure that the extracted terms for each emotion label do not appear in the other lists. In the real world, you would then manually curate the generated lists to ensure that associated words were useful and emotive. For the assignment, you won't be required to further curate the generated lists.\n",
